# Github-Tutorial
Hi, I’m Shantanu Rana. Currently I’m in my third year. But I want to make things easy to all of you. I have watched Kunal Kushwaha’s video on git and github. After watching his video I decided to compile the things and prepared a tutorial pdf by myself.
One can watch his video and and then refer to this pdf.
